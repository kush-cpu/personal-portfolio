## 👋 About Me

I'm a **Graphics & Game Engine Engineer** who thrives in the trenches of **low-level systems development**, building performance-critical pipelines for real-time 3D, simulation, and game technology. My toolkit spans **C++**, **Rust**, and even **Assembly**, with deep hands-on experience in **GPU programming**, **rendering architectures**, and custom engine tooling.

I specialize in **engine-side problem-solving** — designing renderers, profiling GPU bottlenecks, writing shaders, and optimizing multi-threaded pipelines. Whether it’s building on **DirectX**, **Vulkan**, or extending **Unity**/**Unreal Engine**, I build systems meant to **run close to the metal** — fast, deterministic, and scalable.

🔧 **Core Competencies:**

- 🎮 **Game Engine Development**: Custom render loops, ECS architectures, asset pipelines, tooling in C++ & Rust  
- 🎨 **Graphics Programming**: HLSL, GLSL, PBR, GPU debugging (RenderDoc, PIX), performance optimization  
- 🧠 **Systems Programming**: Memory management, multithreading, SIMD, compile-time optimization  
- 🔍 **Profiling & Optimization**: Shader debugging, frame analysis, CPU/GPU co-scheduling, cache-aware design  

But I’m not just about bits and buffers.

I also bring **end-to-end product thinking** through **Full-Stack Development** and **MLOps**:

- 🌐 **Web Stack**: React.js, TypeScript, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, MongoDB  
- ⚙️ **MLOps Tooling**: Docker, Kubernetes, Streamlit, CI/CD, model deployment, API inference servers  
- 🔗 **API Design**: REST, GraphQL, gRPC integrations between ML services and real-time apps

Currently, I'm building **SyntheAI**, a no-code ML platform blending **synthetic data generation** with real-world AI deployment pipelines — aimed at making ML accessible without sacrificing control over performance or system design.

> I live at the intersection of **graphics, systems engineering, and ML infra** — where raw performance meets elegant architecture.

If you're building real-time engines, simulation tech, or scalable AI infrastructure — I bring **core engineering firepower with product execution fluency**.
