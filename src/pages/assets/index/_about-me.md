## 👋 About Me

I'm a **Game Engine Developer** and **Full-Stack Engineer** with a deep interest in **MLOps** and scalable systems. My background spans real-time rendering, engine optimization, and tooling for performance-critical applications — combined with modern full-stack development and machine learning infrastructure.

I build both the **core systems** and the **interfaces**: from crafting **custom rendering pipelines** in C++ and HLSL to shipping **React + TypeScript** frontends and building robust **APIs** using **Go**, **Python**, or **Node.js**.

🔧 **What I do:**

- 🕹️ **Engine & Graphics Programming**: Unity, Unreal, DirectX, Vulkan, GPU profiling, shader authoring
- 🌐 **Full-Stack Development**: React.js, TypeScript, FastAPI, Express, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- ⚙️ **MLOps & Infra**: Docker, Kubernetes, Streamlit, CI/CD, model packaging, and deployment

I'm currently building systems where **interactive 3D, AI, and real-time data converge**, while working on projects that push the boundaries of both **game engine tech** and **ML pipelines**. I prefer working at the intersection of **low-level systems** and **product-focused development**, shipping features that scale and perform under load.

If your stack involves **pixels, data, or scale** — we’re speaking the same language.
